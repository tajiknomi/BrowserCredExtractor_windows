## What is does?
Extract stored credentials of various browsers (i.e. Chrome, Brave, Edge, Opera).

#### Upate for firefox will be soon added.
## Quick Start

Grab the latest binary from the [release section](https://github.com/tajiknomi/Browsers_MasterKey_Extractor/releases) and turn off the AV on the machine
 

1: Run the `extractMasterKeys.exe` on the target machine to extract the AES Master key of various browser(s)
```
$ extractMasterKeys.exe <path/to/output/dir>
```

`<path/to/output/dir>` will contain the output extracted keys and corresponding files of installed browsers.


2: Run the python script i.e. `browserCredDecryptor.py` on your machine and provide the key and files extracted by the above utility. e.g.

```
$ python browserCredDecryptor.py
Enter the AES key (hex): 37ac4ebd676cf9bfb910a4e34a9778467cc288730091f3da057adb7141d3de2b
Enter the path to the 'Login Data' file: path/to/Login Data
``` 

### Note:
`browserCredDecryptor.py` depends on `pycryptodome` package and its better to install the package in python virtual environment so that it doesn't conflict with your crypto package(s).

Windows
```
$ python -m venv virtual_env && virtual_env\Scripts\activate
$ pip install pycryptodome
```
Linux
```
$ apt install python3.12-venv && python3 -m venv virtual_env && source virtual_env/bin/activate
$ pip install pycryptodome
```

## The reason behind spliting the process
During a security assessment, you can utilize `extractMasterKeys.exe` to extract the master key and essential files without requiring additional dependency on the target. By focusing solely on key extraction,it keeps the software footprint small and is slightly OPSEC-SAFE tactic.

## How to build
```
$ cd "Extract Master Keys" && mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build . --config Release
```

You can specify the [cmake-generator](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html) to create configuration files for your build system e.g.

```
$ cmake -A x64 ..
$ cmake -A Win32 ..
$ cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 ..
```
